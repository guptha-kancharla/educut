<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order for the entire world to really become equal, it needs to start with education.

<h3>4. Allows For Self-Dependency</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The importance of education is evident when it comes to being self-dependent. If we are we educated, then it’s something that belongs to us, and only us, allowing us to rely on no one else other than ourselves. It can allow you to not only be financially independent, but also to make your own choices.</p>
