<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Career guidance after 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;or 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;is the process of helping individuals in making adequate educational and occupational choices and in taking career decisions based on the demand and requirements of the future of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It helps individuals make a shift from the general understanding of life and work to a more specific understanding of the realistic and practical career options that are available to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/careers-guidance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collins dictionary</a>,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Career Guidance refers to the advice and information about careers that help individuals, esp. young people, decide on a career and also teaches them how to pursue their chosen career.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The process of&nbsp;<a href="https://idreamcareer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">career guidance</a>&nbsp;for students involves helping them to achieve their identified career options or acquiring their professional goals. The role of a career consultant expert ranges from acting as a guide to leading the entire course of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take for an example, a student is pretty sure about what he wants to do, say he wants to become an Architect. So, proper guidance would help him choose the right&nbsp;<a href="https://idreamcareer.com/career-guidance-for-9th-and-10th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream in 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;class</a>, what entrance exams he should prepare for, which colleges to seek admission in and what scholarships are available for him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most interchangeable terms are Career guidance and career counselling for students. But can these terms be really used as an alternative? Let’s find out what is the difference between career guidance and career counselling in India.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-the-difference-between-career-guidance-and-career-counselling">What is the difference between career guidance and career counselling?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The difference between the two is that on one hand guidance is assisting individuals in achieving their desired career goals which include acting as a guide, leading and setting up a course of action, whereas career counselling online, not very different from guidance, is a process which helps individuals in knowing and understanding themselves through career assessment tests or psychometric tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the career counselling online process, an individual’s interests, personalities, abilities and aptitudes are evaluated through a psychometric test, and on the basis of the report generated, the individual is guided towards a particular direction or career path. While&nbsp;<a href="https://idreamcareer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">career counselling</a>&nbsp;for students is mostly recommended after 10<sup>th</sup>/ 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;or graduate level, individuals can go for guidance at any point in life either to discuss their future goals and career aspirations or to understand the prospects of the career they are currently pursuing or other reasons.</p>
